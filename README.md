# hack-gt-19
our ping-pong website

on the weekend of october 27, 2019, our HackGT team learned HTML, CSS, and some Javascript in order to make a minimum viable product for a website that tracks ping-pong players

this website allows ping-pong players to notify others that they're using the table and at what time they started using it.
