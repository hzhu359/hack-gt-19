# hack-gt-19
our ping-pong website!

On the weekend of October 27, 2019, our HackGT team made a minimum viable product to track ping-pong players at Georgia Tech.

We learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to make a website that allows ping-pong players to tell others if a ping-pong table is in use and when they started using it.
